I got a 12oz latte and was very surprised at the cute cat latte art the barista had made! My friend got an americano, so no latte art for him. About 5 minutes before our reservation, one of the staff came out and gave us a rundown on some rules to make sure we can enjoy our time with the cats to the fullest. The cats were adorable and really liked my friend, he had 3 of them playing with him at one point. We would totally come by again!",
