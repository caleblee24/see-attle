    <p>Put answers here!</p>
    <p>There's a lack of apps to help users discover their local neighborhoods beyond the usual food and drink options. While out with friends, it's very common to go grab lunch together or drinks at a bar, but what about when you want to do other things that aren't of that nature? There's <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> for restaurant discovery and reviews, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/">TripAdvisor</a> for very touristy destinations, and Apple Maps, which does dabble with place suggestions but at its core, it is a navigation service. Apple Maps does show the user nearby places and lets the user filter down to just nearby restaurants, grocery stores, bars, coffee shops, etc. but the main features of it is primarily for people who already know where they want to go. Our app will aim to fill this void by aiding users in exploring their local neighborhoods and finding exciting activities beyond the usual dining and drinking options.</p>

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <p>
      1. User Demographics and Impact:<br>
      Our web application is designed for users in the Seattle area, with a particular focus on out-of-state and international students who may need to become more familiar with the area. By providing a user-friendly interface for discovering and exploring local attractions, our app aims to improve the overall experience of living and studying in Seattle for these user groups.
      We are also mindful of the potential impact that our app may have on minority groups in the area. To ensure that our filters and search results remain unbiased and inclusive, we will be conducting regular audits of our data sources and algorithms, and soliciting feedback from users from diverse backgrounds.
    </p>
      <p>
      2. Interactive Features:
        <br>Our web app will include several interactive features to enhance the user experience:
      <ul>
        <li>Search bar/filter: Users can search for specific locations or filter results based on criteria such as distance, category, rating, or price.</li>
        <li>Interactive map: The map interface provides a visual representation of the search results and allows users to zoom in/out and pan around the area.</li>
        <li>Favorite a location: Users can save their favorite locations for easy access later.</li>
        <li>Reviews on locations: Users can read and submit reviews of the locations they visit, which will be displayed on the location page.</li>
        <li>Requesting to add a location (build on to the map): Users can request to add new locations to the map, which will be reviewed and approved by system admins.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
     <p> 3. Information and Data Sources:<br>
      When a user opens the web app, they will see a map centered on their current location (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a> technology). The search bar is located at the top of the screen, and users can enter specific search terms or filter results based on predefined categories. Once the results are filtered through the DB and server it is then sent back to the user as a list of options that the user can select from. To provide accurate and up-to-date information, our app will draw data from a combination of sources, including our database and third-party APIs. For example, we may use Google Maps API to obtain location data and directions, Yelp API to get ratings and reviews, and Eventbrite API to find local events.

      4. Our Apps Solution: Our app aims to alleviate the issue of a lack of social activity opportunities in the area of Seattle. This is a significant social issue not due to a need for an increase in social activities but the implications that Seattle's citizens would face due to a lack of having access to social activities around them. As social beings, humans face negative physical and mental health outcomes when faced with a lack of interaction and socializition with other human beings. Our web app hopes to prevent the
