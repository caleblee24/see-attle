    <p>There's a lack of apps to help users discover their local neighborhoods beyond the usual food and drink options. While out with friends, it's very common to go grab lunch together or drinks at a bar, but what about when you want to do other things that aren't of that nature? There's <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp</a> for restaurant discovery and reviews, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/">TripAdvisor</a> for very touristy destinations, and Apple Maps, which does dabble with place suggestions but at its core, it is a navigation service. Apple Maps does show the user nearby places and lets the user filter down to just nearby restaurants, grocery stores, bars, coffee shops, etc. but the main features of it is primarily for people who already know where they want to go. Our app will aim to fill this void by aiding users in exploring their local neighborhoods and finding exciting activities beyond the usual dining and drinking options.</p>
